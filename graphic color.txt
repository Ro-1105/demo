COLOR THEORY:

HUE
SATURATION
VALUE

1. HUE-it is the easy one it basically just another word for "color".

2. SATURATION -it refers to intensity,whether the color appears more subtle or vibrate.

3. value - it has to do with how dark or light the color is, ranging from black to white.

color harmony-combining of colors.
we can do that easily by using the easiest formula is monochromatic .

monochromatic is nothing but the it uses only the one color and hue.

analogous- uses colors that are next to each other on the wheel.

complementary - they are opposite to each other on the wheel.

split complementary- uses the color scheme on either side of complement.

triadic - it uses the three colors that are evenly spaced, forming a perfect triangle.

tetradic- it forms the rectangle on the wheel,using not one but two complementary.


readability is an important factor in any design. it should be legible.
